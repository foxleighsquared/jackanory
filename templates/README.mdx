# Templates

Templates, like pages and partials are components which are allowed to have access
to the application context.

All templates should have a folder with the same name as the template and contain
at least an `index.tsx` and a `[templatename].stories.tsx` file.

Unless there are special requirements for a template which require custom documentation
you do not need to create a [templatename].mdx file for the template.

<Tip type="warning">
  Testing light and dark modes on templates MUST be done via the storybook theme switcher in
  the toolbar at the top of the page. The in-page theme switcher will not work
  inside the storybook iframe.
