# Partials

Partials can be thought of as building blocks for pages or even reusable pages
in their own right.

Partials, like templates and pages are components which are allowed to have full access
to the application context.

Unless there are special requirements for a page which require custom documentation
you do not need to create a [partialname].mdx file for the page.

## Partial as a page

Partials can be used as pages in their own right. This is useful for creating
reusable pages which can be used in multiple places in the app, e.g. a
loading page or page which cannot be navigated to directly (e.g. an error page)

If you are using a partial as a resuable page, you should ensure that it extends
the `BaseLayout` template. This will ensure that the page has the correct
styling and headers.

<Tip type="warning">
  Testing light and dark modes on pages MUST be done via the storybook theme switcher in
  the toolbar at the top of the page. The in-page theme switcher will not work
  inside the storybook iframe.
