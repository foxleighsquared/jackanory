<Description  />

As with other Factory components, the List Factory is a wrapper around the List and ListItem components
that provides a set of props that can be used to generate a working List without having to handle any of the
complexity of the components themselves.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Usage

A full List can be generated by passing an array of objects to the `items` prop. Each object should have at least a `content`
property, which should be a React component or DOM element.

## List type

By default, the List Factory will generate a `ul` element without a visible marker. This can be changed by passing a `type`
prop to the List Factory. This can be either `ordered` or `unordered`.

### Ordered list

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.OrderedList} />

### Unordered list

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.UnorderedList} />

## Interactions

The List Factory can be used to generate an interactive list by passing an `onItemClick` prop to the List Factory. This
will be called with the index of the clicked item when it is clicked along with the event object.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithClickableItems} />

You can also add a custom `onClick` handler to each individual item by passing an `onClick` prop inside the `items` array.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithCustomClickHandlerOnEachItem} />

## Example usage

As a ListItem can be any React component, you can create some very flexible lists. Here is an example of a users list.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.UserListExample} />
