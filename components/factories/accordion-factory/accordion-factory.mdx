<Description  />

As with other Factory components, the Accordion Factory is a wrapper around the Accordion and AccordionItem components
that provides a set of props that can be used to generate a working accordion without having to handle any of the
complexity of the components themselves.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Usage

A full accordion can be generated by passing an array of objects to the `items` prop. Each object should have a `header`
and `body` property, which will be used to generate the accordion item.

The `body` property should be a React component or DOM element and the `header` property should be a string.

### Multiple open items

By default, the AccordionFactory only allows a single item to be open at a time. This can be changed by setting the
`allowMultiple` prop to `true`.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.AllowMultipleOpenItems} />

### Specifiying the open item(s)

You can also specify which items should be open by default by setting `isOpen` to `true` on the relevant item(s).

<Tip type="note">Obviously if you are going to specify more than one item as open, you will need to set `allowMultiple` to `true`.</Tip>

## Changing the header level

By default, the accordion items will be rendered with an `<h3>` tag for the header. This can be changed by setting the
`headerLevel` prop to any valid HTML heading level excluding `<h1>`.

### Adding custom click handlers

You can add custom click handlers to the accordion items by passing a function to the `onClick` prop for that item.

<Tip type="note">To see the results of the click handler, you'll need to view the 'actions' tab in the <a href="/?path=/story/components-factories-accordion-factory--with-click-handler">With Click Handler</a> story.</Tip>
