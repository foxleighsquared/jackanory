# Factory components

Factory components are components that are used to create collections of other components,
from a single component definition.

## Data factories

Most of the time you will use the factories to generate components purely from
data. A prime example of this is the [TableFactory](?path=/docs/components-factories-table-factory--docs)
component, which is a factory that generates a table from a data source.

This is a big time saver, as you don't have to manually create a table component
and then add and configure all the rows and cells. You can just pass the data
to the factory and it will generate the table for you.

## Collation factories

Sometimes you will want to generate a more complex pattern of components, e.g. a
form input with validation, a label and help text. You could do this by adding
the components manually (and sometimes you may still want to do this if you want
to add something that the factory doesn't support), but it is usually easier to
just use the [InputFactory](?path=/docs/components-factories-input-factory--docs)
component, which will generate the components for you and will also handle the
input logic.
