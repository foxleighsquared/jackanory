<Description  />

As with other Factory components, the Table Factory is a wrapper around the Table component and all of its child
components and provides a set of props that can be used to generate a working Table without having to handle any of the
complexity of the components themselves.

<Primary />

<Controls />

The TableFactory can take any JSON data and render it as a table. The data is parsed and the keys are used as the
column headers. The values are used as the row data. The data can be any JSON object, but it is recommended that the
data be an array of objects with the same keys. This will ensure that the table is rendered correctly.

<Tip type="warning">The data used for a cell can be a string, number, boolean, array or even a valid JSX element. However
if the data is an object, the object will rendered as a string which reads "[object Object]".</Tip>

## Table Headers

By default the table renders with a solid header. This can be changed to a transparent header by setting the
solidHeader prop to false.

You can even disabled headers completely by setting the showHeader prop to false.

## Table Striping

By default the table renders with striped rows. This can be changed to a solid row by setting the striped prop to false.

## Table Sorting

You can enable sorting on the table by passing a set of options to the `sortable` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SortSpecificColumns} />

You can also enable sorting on all columns by passing `sortable` an array with just '*' as the only value.

## Table Filtering

You can enable filtering on the table by passing an array of column numbers (starting at 1) to the `filterable` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.FilterSpecificColumns} />

You can also enable filtering on all columns by passing an array with just '*' to the `filterable` prop.
