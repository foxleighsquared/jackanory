The loaders can be set to a few different colour variants. The default is `primary`. Take a look at the props panel above
to look at the colour options.

<Tip type="warning">One of the options is 'white'. This is useful for putting a loader on an item which is always dark. However if that item is light in dark-mode, then the loader will still be white. Use this option with caution.</Tip>

## Loader Types

There are four different types of Loader depending on your use case:

### Bar

The `bar` type displays a bar the full-width of the container and displays a bar moving from left to right in an infinite loop.

This should be used when a full page is loading and appears at the top above all other content.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Bar} />

### Spinner

The `spinner` type displays aan arc in a spinner animation. This is the default type.

This is used when a component is loading and appears in the center of the component.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Spinner} />

### Dots

The `dots` type displays four resizing dots.

This is used when a small component is loading. (e.g. a button).

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Dots} />


### Percentage Bar

The `percentage-bar` type displays a bar the full-width of the container and displays a bar expanding from left to right based on the value of the `progress` prop.

This should be used when you are loading an item and you know how long it will take to load. (e.g. a file transfer).

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.PercentageBar} />

## Loader size

You can set the size of the loader by passing a `size` prop. The default size is `80px`.

<Tip type="note">The 'bar' and 'percentage-bar' loaders are not affected by this prop.</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SetWidth} />

## Loader label

You can set a label for the loader by passing a `label` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.BarWithLabel} />
