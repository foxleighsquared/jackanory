## With different button variants

You can change the button variants by passing the `confirmVariant` and `cancelVariant` props.

As you can see in the above example, having a green button to confirm a delete action is a bit odd. So you can change the variant to `destroy` instead.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.ButtonVariants} />

## Confirm only

If you only want the dialogue to display a confirm button then you only need to pass the `confirmAction` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.ConfirmOnly} />

## Custom labels

You can change the labels on the buttons by passing the `confirmLabel` and `cancelLabel` props.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.CustomLabels} />

## Extra information

Sometimes just a title isn't enough context for the user. If you want to pass an additional message to the user you can pass the `message` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithMessage} />

## Expand to fit container

You can make the dialog expand to fit the container by passing the `fitContainer` prop. This is useful if you want to use the dialogue in a modal.

<Tip type="warning"> The dialog content will still be centered in the middle of the container. So be mindful of the height of the container or it might look odd.</Tip>
