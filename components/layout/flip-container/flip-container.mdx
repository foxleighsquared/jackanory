Any DOM element or React Component can be used within a flip container. Simply pass your content to the `front` and `back` props.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Controlling the flip

By default, the flip container will flip when the user clicks on it. However there are two other ways to control the flip:

### On hover

You can set the `flipType` to `hover` to flip the container when the user hovers over it.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.HoverFlip} />

### Via external controls

You can also set the `flipType` to `controlled` and control the flip via external controls using the `isFlipped` prop.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.ControlledFlip} />

<Tip type="warning">If the flip container is being controlled by an external button, the button should be given an `aria-controls` attribute with the value of the flip container's `id` attribute. The button should also be given an `aria-expanded` attribute with the value of `true` when the flip container is visible and `false` when it is hidden.</Tip>


## Positioning issues

If you are having issues where the flip animation is causing the scrollbar to jump, you can add a `className` prop to the flip container and add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

  ```css
  .your-class-name {
  perspective-origin: bottom;
}
```

This will cause the flip animation to originate from the bottom of the flip container, which will prevent the scrollbar from jumping. You can also use `perspective-origin: top` if you want the flip animation to originate from the top of the flip container instead.
