<Description of={Card} />

By default, the card only has a background, a border-radius and a drop shadow (all of which can be disabled) and displays the content in a
in a single row css grid layout. It relies on the child components to set the appropriate width, height and internal spacing.

External spacing around the card should ideally be set by the parent component but you can add spacing to the card itself by passing in
the `vSpacing` and/or `hSpacing` boolean props.

You can also pass a `className` prop and style it yourself but this is discouraged unless absolutely necessary.

<Tip>As the <a href="/docs/components-layout-card-components-card-header--docs">CardHeader</a> and <a href="/docs/components-layout-card-components-card-body--docs">CardBody</a> components are children, you can not interact with their props from within this story. To see the props available to these components, please see their own stories</Tip>

## Usage

You can pass any child you want to the Card component, but to get the best out of it, you should use the pre-styled CardHeader and CardBody components.

### CardBody

The CardBody component adds some extra padding and automatically expands to the available space within the card.

You can import the `CardBody` component directly from the `components/cards/components/card-body` folder if you wish, however it is recommended to
import the `Card` component and then use `Card.Body` to access the CardBody component.

<Tip type="warning">
  The contents of CardBody will not have any default styling applied to it, so you will need to add your own.
</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithBody} />

### CardHeader

The CardHeader component adds some extra padding and a bottom border to the card.

You can import the `CardHeader` component directly from the `components/cards/components/card-header` folder if you wish, however it is recommended to
import the `Card` component and then use `Card.Header` to access the CardBody component.

The component automatically detects there are 2 children here and has adjusted the CSS
grid layout to make room for the header.

<Tip type="danger">
  This component is not that smart, it assumes if there are two children then
  the first one is a CardHeader.
</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithHeader} />

By default, the header is transparent but you can pass a 'bg' prop to change the background color of the header to one of 'primary', 'secondary' or 'tertiary'

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithPrimaryHeader} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithSecondaryHeader} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithTertiaryHeader} />

## Status Header colours

The CardHeader also supports the status colours. You can pass a 'bg' prop to change the background color of the header to one of 'success', 'warning', 'danger' or 'info'

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithSuccessHeader} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithWarningHeader} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithDangerHeader} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithInfoHeader} />

## Supports Cards

<a id="compatibility"></a>

The CardHeader and CardBody component were made for the `Card` component, however they also work as children of other components.
If you see the badge below, it means the component supports the CardHeader and CardBody components without needing to include the Card component itself.
