<Description of={Masthead} />

Masthead is a core component and is included automatically in the [BaseLayout](/docs/templates-base-layout-layout--docs) template.

<Tip type="note">The theme switcher functionality does not work inside Storybook. You will need to run the next app to see it in action.</Tip>

You can also set the active link by passing the `currentPath` prop to the `Masthead` component.

## With announcements

Applictation-wide announcement banners can be displayed in the masthead via the `announcements` prop. This prop accepts an array of objects with the following properties:

- `id` - a unique identifier for the announcement
- `type` - the type of announcement to display. This can be one of `info`, `warning` or `error`
- `text` - the text to display in the announcement

You can add the `onAnnouncementDismiss` prop to the `Masthead` component to receive a callback when a announcement is dismissed, which contains the full announcement object.

<Tip type="warning">This banner is not for displaying feedback from user actions. Use one of the components in `Feedback` for that.</Tip>
