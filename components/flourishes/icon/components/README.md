If you want to add a new icon, add an SVG file with the icon name (in kebab-case)
to the 'public/icons' folder and run 'yarn generate:icons' to generate the new
icon component.

If you want to delete an icon, delete the SVG file from the 'public/icons' folder
and run 'yarn generate:icons' to delete the icon component.

If you want to edit an icon, edit the SVG file in the 'public/icons' folder and
run 'yarn generate:icons' to regenerate the icon component.
