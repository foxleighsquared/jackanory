<Description />

This component is a simple wrapper with an additional `Accordion.Item` component
included for convenience.

Rather than use this component directly, consider using the <a href="/?path=/docs/components-factories-accordion-factory--docs">AccordionFactory</a> component to generate your accordion from data.

Using this component alongside `Accordion.Item` allows you to build an accordion from scratch
This can be useful if your requirements are more complex than the `AccordionFactory` component can handle.

<Controls />

## Usage examples

Here are two examples of how you might use this component, both of these examples
are availble from the <a href="/?path=/docs/components-factories-accordion-factory--docs">AccordionFactory</a> component.

### Specify the open item

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithOpenItem} />

### Limit the number of open items to one

<Tip type="note">If you use the AccordionFactory, this is the default behaviour.</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.LimitOpenItemsToOne} />
