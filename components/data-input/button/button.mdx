import * as Stories from './button.stories';

import { Button } from 'components';

<Meta of={Stories} />

<Title of={Button} />

<Description of={Button} />

<Tip>
  It's also possible to turn a regular button element or link into a basic
  button by adding the `button` utility to it although that method is cosmetic
  only and lacks the more advanced features of this component.

## Button content

The button component can accept any content as a child, including other components or you can use
the `label` and `icon` props to add a label and icon to the button.

Most examples in this documentation use the `label` and `icon` props to make it easier to
see what is happening. However here is an example of a button which uses children instead.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithChildren} />

<Tip>Whilst we don't recommend it, you can use this method to add icons which are not in the icon library. You will need to pass 'custom' to the `icon` prop if you wish to take advantage of the existing item styling</Tip>

## Variants

### Primary

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Secondary} />

### Secondary

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Secondary} />

### Create

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Create} />

### Destroy

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown"  of={Stories.Destroy} />

## Text only buttons

You have two options if you want to display a text button:

### Transparent button

The 'transparent' button will render a button with the
same padding and sizing as a normal button but with no background. To use this
button, pass the 'transparent' prop to the button.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Transparent} />

### Link button

The text variant will display the same as a link but will still be a button with
all the same functionality. To use this button, pass the 'link' prop to the button.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.DisplayAsLink} />

## Circular button

A button can also be circular. Protip: Limit the amount of text you
put in a circular button or better yet, use only an icon. This avoids creating
huge buttons.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Circular} />

## Icon buttons

You can also use any icon from the icon library as a button by passing the
`icon` prop with the name of the icon you want to use.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithIcon} />

By default the icon will be aligned to the left of the button, you can change this by
passing the `alignIcon` prop with either 'left' or 'right'.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.IconLeft} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.IconRight} />


## Small button

Sometimes you need a smaller button, you can use the 'small' prop to make the button
smaller.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Small} />

Icons also work with small buttons.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SmallWithIcon} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SmallWithIconAndLabel} />

## Loading state

You can pass a 'loading' prop to the button to show a loading state. This will
add a spinner to the button and disable it, you can also pass a 'loadingText'
prop to show a custom loading text. By default the loading text is 'Loading...'

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Loading} />

## Usage

### Use as a link

A Button component can be used to style a link, however you must wrap the component
in the correct routing method of your framework for it to work.

e.g.

```jsx
<Link href="/marketplace">
  <Button alignIcon="left">
    <Icon name="back" /> Return to Home page
  </Button>
</Link>
```
