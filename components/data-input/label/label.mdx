  It is very important that you pass the same `id` prop value to the Label and the input

## Required label

You can add a 'required' asterisk to the label by passing the 'required' prop to the component.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Required} />

## Large label

The label can also be a larger label (which looks like a form Legend) by passing the 'largeLabel' prop to the component.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Large} />

## Simulated label

You can also use the Label component to create a 'fake' label where a real label is not available / appropriate.

<Tip type="warning">
  This is not a recommended pattern and should only be used in exceptional circumstances. You will also need to manually
  add any margins to ensure the label is positioned correctly.
</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Simulated} />

## Input as child

You can also pass an input as a child to the Label component. If you do this,
the label will be automatically associated with the input, however you will still
need to pass the `id` prop as this is used to generate the test id and to hook
into the validation system.

<Tip> Some components can have issues when rendered via the InputFactory component. If you are having an issue try passing the `parent` prop to the label. This will prevent the `htmlFor` attribute from being set which usually fixes the issue.  </Tip>

## Label Position

If the input is a child of the label (see above), you may wish to alter the labels
position relative to the input. By default the label will be positioned above the input. You can change this by
passing the `position` prop to the component. Valid values are `above`, `before` and `after`.
