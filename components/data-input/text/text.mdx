## Non-text types
In spite of it's name, the `Text` component can also be used to collect any kind of text, based input including, email addresses, numbers and more.

Check the props table below or have a play with the controls to see the full list of types.

Here's an example of the 'number' type.

## Mobile only types

The following types do not do anything exciting on desktop devices,
however on a mobile device, they will change the users keyboard to
include extra features. Such as a number pad or a '.com' button.

Appearance-wise, they all appear as a reuglar text input, so it makes sense to
group them together, view this page on mobile to see the differences.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Email} />

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.URL} />
